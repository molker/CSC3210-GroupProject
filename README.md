# CSC3210-GroupProject :computer:
> Contributors: Matthew Olker, Spencer Peters, Chad Sigmon, Rahul

> This is the final group project for the CSC3210 class, involving making a database with multiple tables and multiple attributes per table to show and understanding of database design. 
### Topic: Sports :football:
* Because of the need to have many different tables that make sense to be apart, we chose football specifically because it is something Spencer understands and it is something we can effectively split into many tables without it seeming meaningless. It also allows for different types of relationships that will show we understand database design and the basics of mySQL.
* Tables
	* Divisions
	* Teams
	* Seasons
	* Sponsors
	* Members
	* Coaches
	* Players
	* Owners
	* Statistics
